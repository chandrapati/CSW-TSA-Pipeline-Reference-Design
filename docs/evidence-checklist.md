# TSA Pipeline Security Directive — CSW Evidence Checklist

A printable worklist for the evidence owner. For each item: **what** to export, **where** from in CSW, and the **cadence**. Tick as you collect; file exports to immutable storage (not screenshots taken during audit week).

> Legend — 🟢 Direct · 🟠 Supporting · ⚪ Evidence Required *(supplied outside CSW)*. CSW evidence is an input to compliance, not an attestation.

---

## Phase 1 — Coverage (Days 1–10)

- [ ] In-scope host list reconciled to **CSW Inventory** (100% or documented exceptions)
- [ ] Labels applied: `compliance:tsa-pipeline`, `data:<class>`, `env:<tier>`, `app:*`, `owner:*`
- [ ] CSW scope tree created matching the compliance boundary
- [ ] **Export:** inventory CSV + agent-status screenshot → `evidence/01-coverage/`

## Phase 2 — Baseline (Days 11–28)

- [ ] ADM running on the compliance scope for ≥ 2 weeks (full business cycle)
- [ ] Unexpected flows documented (shadow IT, vendor egress, scope creep)
- [ ] App owners signed the cluster-to-application mapping
- [ ] **Export:** ADM diagram + flow samples with process context → `evidence/02-baseline/`

## Phase 3 — Policy (Days 29–45)

- [ ] Default-deny posture defined for the sensitive scope
- [ ] ADM-imported rules refined; **Simulation** run ≥ 1 week
- [ ] Change tickets raised for false positives; exception register updated
- [ ] **Export:** policy export + simulation report → `evidence/03-policy/`

## Phase 4 — Operate (ongoing)

- [ ] Enforcement enabled; negative test recorded in **Denied Connections**
- [ ] SIEM integration verified with sample events
- [ ] Quarterly binder assembled
- [ ] **Export:** enforcement screenshot + quarterly binder → `evidence/04-operate/`
